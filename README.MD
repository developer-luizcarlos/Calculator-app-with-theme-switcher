## About the project
This project is about a calculator app to evaluate mathematical expressions, based on the Calculator App Challenge found on [Frontend Mentor's website](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It includes a functionality to switch between three different color themes, which is saved on the localStorage to keep the preferences previously defined by the user; the default theme is the blue one, which was shown before in the previous section.

## Development details
I have been reading a book called 'Algoritimos e lógica de programação com Javascript', written by Edécio Fernando Lepsen, which gave me some interesting ideas to implement in my projects. One of them was doing searches in a string by specific values and also extract a value from a string; this was what I did in this calculator app to avoid using 'global variables' to add or not mathematical operational symbols on the calculator screen, and this simple idea let me free of unnecessary code and turned the process of creating extra features much more easier as well.
